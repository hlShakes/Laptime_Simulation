# Laptime_Simulation
Lap time simulation for the Isle of Man TT race. Written to support my Master's dissertation. 

Old, inefficient and far from perfect. This was built as a tool to support the later parts of my research so has been rushed in places accordingly. 
Wasn't using Git at the time of writing so uploaded directly to archive...
